First HTML project - Basic recipe website 

Goal: 
- In this project, I built a basic recipe website.
The website consist of a main index page which has links to a few recipes. The website does not look really pretty. I will revist this project in the future to style it up with CSS

Learnings:
- Use of HTML Boilerplate
- Use and resize of images
- Defining different headers
- Unordered Lists
- Ordered Lists
- Definition of relative links
